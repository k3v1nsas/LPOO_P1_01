1. Suppose that you have created a program with only the following variables:
int v = 4;
int w = 6;
double x = 2.2;
Suppose that you also have a method with the following header:
public static void calculate(int x, double y)
Which of the following method calls are legal?
a. calculate(v, w);	Ilegal
b. calculate(v, x);	Legal
c. calculate(x, y);	Ilegal
d. calculate(18, x);	Legal
e. calculate(1.1, 2.2);	Ilegal
f. calculate(5, 7);	Legal
